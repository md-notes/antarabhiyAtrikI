## 2 Minute Crash Course

- _Remind Yourself_ that your responsibility is limitless.
- _Remind Yourself_ “this moment” is inevitable and it is the way it is.
- _Remind Yourself_ that your Body and Mind are a gathering and not you.

## 1. Mechanics of Life

- All work outside is useful only when your inner experience is enhanced. How you are within decides it all.
- Anything in our lives be it our parents, our friends, this or that, everything does not happen according to us. But this one person must happen according to ourselves.
- If this one person happens according to you, how would you keep it? Blissful!!
- There are no subtractions or divisions in this mind, whatever you try to do it will become one more, if you try hard then ten more.
- All that you have experienced is all that you know, else everything is imagination.
- What I know I know, what I don’t know that I don’t know. This should be fine.
- Whatever happens within us pain, pleasure, agony, ecstasy or misery, and all that may or may not happen to us, you are the one who needs to be fixed, else it is like punching on the wall instead of the keyboard. When You see this then there is a possibility of transformation.

## 2. The Only Bondage <small>(_Desire_)</small>

- The energy that we call life and the energy that we call desire are not different. If no desire then no life as well.
- The nature of desire is trying to take you to a boundless sense of experience.
- Your Desire is not for more but for all. There is something within you that always tries to become boundless.
- When this boundless nature gets identified with limited physicality, then ego is born.
- Ego is like our shadow, if we have a body we also have an ego. For various types of work, we need different types of ego.
- The problem is that you have lost the distinction between me and my ego.
- All the experience of life is limited to physicality when this is the case desire is a natural outcome, and it always continuously tries to break the boundaries of physicality.
- What you call 'me' cannot be captured in boundaries. It is trying to express itself like that.
- Desire is not a problem, the problem is that it has become a compulsion. If it was happening consciously then everything in our lives would be a wonderful game. <small>(You can play well and roll back and keep it)</small>
- If you want to _free_ this _mind_ from _misery_, you need to provide it with a _strong stable platform_.

## 3. To Live and to live totally <small>(_Responsibility_)</small>

- When you can see that you are _responsible_ for a particular thing you have the _ability to respond_ to that situation. If you think you are _not responsible_ for something you _lose your ability to respond_.
- When you take responsibility for a situation then only you can do something about the situation.
- If you lose your ability to respond, you _unnecessarily react_ to situations.
- Our _responsibility is limitless_ <small>(It just takes some desire and willingness to respond)</small>
- But our _Actions_ are limited by our energy, time, and space. This is an important distinction to understand_.
- The logical and experiential aspects of our lives are diametrically opposite. <small>(Our Mind thinks that taking this much responsibility will make us more miserably, but experientially we know that its much more beautiful and liberating.)</small>
- What we call as _God_ or _Divine_ is limitless responsibility.
- When you see your responsibility is limitless, from an unwilling piece of life you become a _willing piece of life_.
- Whatever happens with you willingly is heaven for us and whatever happens with you unwillingly is surely hell.
- Air, water and everything around are responding to us are responding to us, we are also responding but unconsciously. Do it consciously and see the difference.
- This is neither talking about responsibility nor thinking about it and also not doing it but about _Being Responsible_. <small>(**Because that is how _Life_ is.**)</small>

## 4. You are Not What You Think <small>(_Moment_)</small>

- This moment is inevitable. The way it is right now is what it is and it cannot be any other way in this moment.
- "This Moment is Inevitable" is the moment-to-moment realization you cannot make a teaching out of it.
- Moments are not inevitable but only _this moment is inevitable_.
- If you are aware of whatever is in this moment, then consciously and positively accepting it and being happy is the only way for you. You cannot be any other way.
- You are happy whenever what you want is there in '_this moment_'.
- Happiness is not a special moment, but a continuous state of existence.
- This moment is the only doorway to the creation and the creator.
- The past is just our memory and the future is our imagination.
- If you are in reality, then reality is 'this moment', and if we accept that which is here, then this is the end of suffering in that person.
- If you accept that which is in this moment, then just sitting(सहज होना) is natural. The happiness that one gets just by sitting with ease. Every time something or the other is going on, trying to reach somewhere all the time.
- You are always in this moment. You can think about the past, and future but that is also possible only in this moment. If you are aware that you are in this inevitable moment and then you can think of the future it's not a problem.
- A lot of people are telling not to think of the future, past. But if you don't think of the future, life one day will hit you very hard, really hard. It is better that you think of the upcoming future.
- Thinking about tomorrow is not a problem, trying to live tomorrow is a problem.
- The problem is not with reality, but the problem is with the mind's ability to get illusioned about reality.
- If you see reality the way it is then you can handle it according to your competence. And that is what all it is.
- So "Will it change on my acceptance", no it will not change if you accept or not accept it.
- But if you accept it then you are free from it. This is a significant thing. Your experience about that thing changes.
- Whatever you accept becomes a part of you. Whatever you resist becomes a big obstacle in front of you.

## 5. Mind - The Miracle <small>(_Karma_)</small>

- Everything in this physical world is happening between cause and effect. You are either enjoying its outcome(effect) or suffering it.
- But without any reason, there is no result. <small>(So whatever you think that is happening to you right now is definitely because of a reason but you have became too short-sighted to be able to see that this is your own _Karma_.)</small>
- Doing that which you like to do is not freedom. Doing whatever is needed to be done happily is freedom.
- Your likes and dislikes are the basis of your bondage.
- The way you think, feel and experience life is determined by past impressions. So mind at a very deep level is affected by previous impressions. This conditioning of the mind is called _Karma_.
- If you keep your mind equanimous then slowly slowly karma dissolves.
- Your mind will be equanimous when you accept whatever is in this moment the way it is, you don't like or dislike it. You experience everything the way it is.
- You are Responsible for everything. Even for things before you were born.
- When you can see that life is 100% your making then you will make your life the way you want it.

## 6. Sound of Creation <smalll>(_AUM_)</smalll>

- The whole existence is a complex amalgamation of sounds.
- Every form has a sound associated and every sound has a form associated with it.
- AUM is the primordial sound of the universe.
- When you chant AUM you should be aware of the vibrations it creates in the body. Without any necessary awareness chanting a mantra will bring lathargy.
- Silence is that which is not. Sound is that which is there.
- Silence is the basis of all sounds. All existence is a certain reverberation. And the basic of reverberation(sound) is AUM.
- Silence is the most powerful dimension of our life.
- If you are into creative work, silence should be there.
- Silence should be practiced as it brings more mental clarity.

## 7. Creating what you want

- Life is perceived only when you are aware of it, and alert of it.
- Currently, our memory has overtaken our awareness.
- Everything in this universe is fresh "every moment". Nothing repeats itself. But Your Mind Repeats it.
- If you live in the creator's creation, nobody can think of creation better than it.
- Because you are stuck in your mind, you think "to be or not to be". So you are not living in the universe but in your luni bin.
- We have not understood the domain of mind, where it should be, and where it should not be.
- There is no problem with all rubbish in mind its useful where it's required, If you spread it everywhere life will be more of a misery.
- Time is a relative experience. If you are happy it passes quickly. If you are miserable it feels very long.
- Whatever the rules are at a place, make it yours. If you see that the game rules are my rules, then you become a part of it, you can know it.
- If you want to experience life as profoundly as possible then the only way is inclusion, only by involvement you will know.
- If you want to experience life you need involvement.
- Involvement will not come until you see the rules that govern that situation and make it a part of yourself.
- If you are not involved then you will miss everything, whether you are in social situations, cities, or jungles.
- You can be involved only when you have the rules of the place a part of yourself.
- Stop bullshitting yourself, at least with yourself you should be 100% straight.
- The moment you identify yourself as 'this' and 'that' as other your integrity is gone. The moment you like, dislike, love, or hate your integrity is gone.
- You should be on self-start, being a full-time human being.
- Meditation is an easy utility, when you are meditative your mind and you are at a distance, and once you are at a certain distance you see it the way it is. When you rise above you are able to see it better.
- When you are stuck in it you can see it differently when you see it with an elevated view.
